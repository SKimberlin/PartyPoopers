# Party Poopers

## Summary
Party Poopers is a game currently being developed in Unreal Engine 5. It is a multiplayer experience where two players must work together to kill all the targets in their dossier. This was made as a project for a Game Programming class that required us to learn and use multiplayer and VR features.

## How to play the game
Two players will need to have the game, one will play in VR and the other on Mouse and Keyboard. The keyboard player will be the sniper, tasked with relaying who their targets are and using the sniper to take them out when they're all alone. The VR player will be at the party, looking for the targets using the info from the sniper player, trying to get them alone in a bathroom using any means possible.
